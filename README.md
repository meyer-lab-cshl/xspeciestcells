To explore the data interactively, you can use our [ShinyCell app](http://xspeciestcells.cshl.edu/). The repository for this shiny app can be found at https://github.com/meyer-lab-cshl/xspeciestcells-shiny.

## Branch purpose

This branch is under construction :construction: , and will be later merged to the main to provide fully reproducible scripts.

## Directory structure

- [`scripts`](./scripts/) contains the final scripts that allow the (1) preprocessing of the data and (2) generation of figures in the manuscript;
- [`figures`](./figures) will contain the final figures present in the manuscript as PDF files;
- [`data_geo`](./data_geo) was created for the user to put the data files deposited on GEO (ADD LINK HERE);
- [`data_github`](./data_github) contains small data files which were not uploaded on GEO (cNMF output files, gene signatures from the literature, etc.).
