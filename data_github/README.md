This directory contains small data files which were not uploaded on GEO, but were used for our analyses. It also contains empty directories which can be populated by data files generated by some scripts (e.g. generating thymic seurat objects).

- [`cNMF`](./cNMF/) contains output `.csv` files generated by the cNMF algorithm;
- [`literature_gene_signatures`](./literature_gene_signatures) contains `.xslx` supplementary data from the literature, with gene signatures of peripheral blood T cells, used for Supplementary Figure 10 in our manuscript;
- [`seurat_objects_thymus`](./seurat_objects_thymus) is an empty directory dedicated to storing individual thymic seurat objects (iNKT, MAIT, &gamma;&delta;T) generated by the script XXXX, which are used for Figure 2D.
