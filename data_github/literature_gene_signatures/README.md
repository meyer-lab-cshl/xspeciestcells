This directory contains supplementary tables from peer-reviewer papers on peripheral blood T cells. These tables contain gene signatures characterizing different cell states of adult peripheral blood T cells, which we compared with the genes characterizing each of our gene expression programs (GEPs) in order to better understand the relevance of our cNMF-inferred GEPs (Supplementary Figure 10 in manuscript).

These tables are used to run the script XXX.

These tables were obtained from:
