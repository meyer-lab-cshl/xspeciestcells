This directory contains files related to the gene expression similarity analysis between our thymocytes dataset and the Human Thymus Atlas (Supplementary Fig 4).

Most of the files are `.gitignored` as they are too heavy to be uploaded to github. However, we have uploaded here the `.csv` output from running pyMetaNeighbor between our dataset and the [Park et al.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay3224) thymocyte dataset. This file, named `human_thym_merged_with_park_pymtn_slow_version_output_240902.csv`, can be used to run the script [pymtn_park_03_plot_metaneighbor.Rmd](../../../scripts/integrated_dataset/pymtn_park_03_plot_metaneighbor.Rmd) and reproduce Supplementary Fig 4.

Here is the list of files which are `.gitignored` and can be generated from your own computer if you would like to reproduce Supplementary Fig 4 from scratch:
- `human_thym_merged_with_park_240902.h5ad` is the file generated by script [pymtn_park_01_prepare_data.Rmd](../../../scripts/integrated_dataset/pymtn_park_01_prepare_data.Rmd), which contains counts and metadata from both our thymocytes data and the Park et al. thymocytes data. This file is used as input to run MetaNeighbor;
- `human_thym_merged_with_park_240902.h5Seurat` is similar as the previous file, it is simply an intermediary file during the conversion from a `Seurat` object to a `.h5ad` file (see end of script [pymtn_park_01_prepare_data.Rmd](../../../scripts/integrated_dataset/pymtn_park_01_prepare_data.Rmd));
- `human_thym_merged_with_park_list_hvg_240902.csv` contains the list of HVGs used to run Metaneighbor (file also generated by script [pymtn_park_01_prepare_data.Rmd](../../../scripts/integrated_dataset/pymtn_park_01_prepare_data.Rmd)).
