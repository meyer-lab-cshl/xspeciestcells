This directory is used to store seurat objects for each thymic lineage (corresponding to Figure 2D in manuscript), generated by scripts in directory [separate_analyses_by_thymic_lineage](../../scripts/separate_analyses_by_thymic_lineage/).
These seurat objects are used afterwards for TCR analyses (Figure 3 in manuscript) and cross-species comparisons (Figure 6 in manuscript).
