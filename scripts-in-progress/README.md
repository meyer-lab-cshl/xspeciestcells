# Scripts in progress

This is where all the magic happens. Where unanswered questions become answered. Where mysteries are resolved. Where new observations lead to new questions, which drive new investigations. The beauty of science.

- [cross-species](./cross-species) will contain scripts related to cross-species analyses (mouse vs human mostly)
- [human-thymus](./human-thymus) will contain general analyses focusing only on the human data (thymus & PBMC, don't get tricked by this terrible folder name) -> integration of the data, analyses at a single lineage level, gene correlations, DE analyses, ...
- [mouse-thymus](./mouse-thymus) contains scripts on integrating mouse CD4/CD8 SP data with mouse NKT data (how overlapping is it?)
- [spatial](./spatial) focuses on inferring the localisation of the different thymocytes on human spatial transcriptomics data from the [Heimli et al.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1092028/full) paper
